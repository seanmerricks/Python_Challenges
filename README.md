Python Challenges

This repository is just a place for me to drop my Jupyter notebooks workings in Python on problems and challenges from various websites such as Project Euler and Python Challenge.

I have no doubt there are much better ways to find the answers, these are just my ways. I'm really new to all of this so I may come back and re-try some of these at a later date to see if I can improve them.
